# HPC

High-performance computing, refers to a set of computers with a large amount of shared resources for processing large computational tasks.

# Login Node

The computer that you are in when you log into Ginsburg. Everybody gets put into one of a few login nodes. It should look something like this when you log in:

```bash
[<UNI>@ruth ~]$
```

Instead of `ruth`, it might be `bader` or `burg` since the cluster is named after the former supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If your UNI was `abc1234`, the login node might say something like this:

```bash
[abc1234@ruth ~]$
```

# Local machine

This is another term for your computer that's in front of you. This is in contrast to a remote machine which is some server somewhere else.
